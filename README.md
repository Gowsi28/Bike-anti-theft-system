🚲 Bike Anti-Theft Alert System

 📌 Overview

The **Bike Anti-Theft Alert System** is a smart IoT-based security solution designed to protect motorcycles from theft. It integrates **NodeMCU (ESP8266/ESP32)** with **GPS**, **relay module**, and the **Blynk IoT platform** to provide real-time alerts, live location tracking, and remote ignition control.



 🎯 Objective

* Track the location of the bike using a **GPS module**.
* Send **real-time alerts** to the owner via the **Blynk mobile app**.
* Allow the user to **remotely disable the ignition system** through a relay.
* Run on a **portable power supply**, making it suitable for all bikes.



🛑 Problem Statement

Motorbike theft is a growing issue, and traditional locks or alarms are insufficient. Existing systems often lack **real-time alerts, remote control, and GPS tracking**. Most rely on **GSM (SMS-based)** communication, which is slower and less reliable compared to IoT-based solutions.



💡 Proposed Solution

Our system uses:

* **Motion sensors** to detect unauthorized activity.
* **GPS** for real-time tracking of the bike’s location.
* **Blynk IoT app** for instant alerts and live monitoring.
* **Relay module** for remotely disabling the ignition system.
* **NodeMCU** as the central microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi for cloud connectivity.


🛠️ Technology Used

* **Microcontroller**: NodeMCU (ESP8266/ESP32)
* **IoT Platform**: Blynk App + Blynk Cloud
* **GPS Module**: NEO-6M (for location tracking)
* **Relay Module**: Controls bike ignition remotely
* **Power Source**: Portable DC battery


⚙️ Features

✔ Real-time theft alerts on smartphone
✔ GPS-based live tracking
✔ Remote ignition cut-off
✔ Cloud-based IoT connectivity (Blynk)
✔ Low-cost and portable design




 ✅ Conclusion

The Bike Anti-Theft Alert System successfully demonstrates the use of IoT for vehicle security. With **real-time alerts, GPS tracking, and remote ignition control**, it provides an affordable yet efficient solution to reduce the risk of bike theft.
